## Running Locally

To setup a virtual environment locally run the standalone script in the root directory:

```bash
./tasks.py init
```

Then before starting a specific chapter, the dependencies are separated, so run the following:

```bash
./tasks.py setup_ch 2
```

Then to start playing with the notebooks run the following:

```bash
./tasks.py start
```
